NAME
----
uguu - Generate flexget config files.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
uguu is a tool to generate flexget configuration files, which aren't well suited
to some use cases, one being having a separate feed for every series, which is
important for fast moving RSS feeds such as Nyaatorrents, or simply if one likes
to download a series without batches using flexget.
